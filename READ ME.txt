1. General information

Title: MetaboNetworks Toolbox

Summary: A Matlab-based tool to create custom sub-networks using main substrate-product pairs as defined by the Kyoto 
		Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). It can be used to explore transgenomic interactions, for
		example mammalian and bacterial associations. It calculates the shortest path between a set of
		metabolites (e.g. biomarkers from a metabonomic study) and plots the connectivity between metabolites
		as links in a network graph. The resulting graph can be changed and explored interactively.
		Furthermore, nodes in the graph are linked to the KEGG compound webpage.

Platform dependence: none found (tested on Windows 7, Mac OSX 7.14 (Snow Leopard))
Software dependence: none found (tested on Matlab versions 2010b, 2012a, 2012b, 2013a, 2013b, 2014a)
                     one found (2014b - software does not work in this version, Mathworks changed GUI style)
Toolbox dependence: none, when Statistics Toolbox is available, Multi-Dimensional Scaling can also be used as layout.

2. How to generate a custom database:

Run in Matlab:

>> MetaboGetworks

This will start a GUI in which multiple organisms can be selected to be included.
Once the list is saved MetaboGetworks will start querying KEGG, depending on which and how many organisms are
	selected (as well as internet connection speeds, etc) this can take between 30 minutes and 20 hours.

3. How to create custom metabolic reaction networks:

Run in Matlab:

>> MetaboNetworks

This will ask to select a database (make sure this is ready) and search for metabolites you want to include.
If the workspace includes variables that are cell-strings, it will ask if any of those contain the metabolite names.
If a cell-string is selected it will see if there are any variables (type double) of the same size that could hold
	the information of the variable association with the response variable Y.
In the GUI that starts up when there are cell-strings in the workspace, there is a button that allows the user to
	search for metabolites. The list is saved in the workspace with the date and time stamp.

To search for metabolites without calling MetaboNetworks:

>> metabolitelist=SearchMetabolites;

This will ask to select a database (make sure this is ready) and search for metabolites you want to include.

When the metabolites have been selected, an association vector can be created for the metabolites.
This has to be a vector (double) the same size as metabolitelist, where each metabolite is assigned a value.
This value can be the correlation of the metabolite with the response variable of the study, the regression
    coefficient or another entity. When this is included, MetaboNetworks will include an option to colour the nodes
    based on this value. The colours of the nodes are plotted and the ranges are between [-1 1] or
    [-1 1]*max(abs(associationvector)). When this option is used, the user is queried for the type of association
    (e.g. correlation, regression coefficients), this will be added to the plot.

>> MetaboNetworks

The GUI will now include metabolitelist as a cell-string that can be chosen for selection.
The MetaboNetworks GUI will start up and the network can be customized.
Hoovering over the menu items will show a small description of each item. This includes different graph layouts,
	deleting nodes, deleting edges, moving nodes, highlighting shortest paths, changing colours of nodes, + more.

4. Examples:

>> mlist={'Creatinine','L-Leucine','L-Alanine'};
>> mlist2={'L-Tyrosine';'Choline';'Citrate'}
>> ylist=[0.90 0.68 -0.35];
>> ylist2=[1;1;-1];
>> % Select mlist or mlist2 from the drop-down menu
>> % Followed by selecting ylist or ylist2 depending on which metabolite list was chosen (or choose none)

5. New in version 2

New in version 2.0 compared to 1.4 (online 16 Sept 2013):

Retain old positions in new network:
  Changed code to keep positions even after new network is generated, then the positions of nodes that are in both
      networks are fixed to their positions in the old network.
  The remaining nodes are optimized based on the fixed positions. To turn this off, and generate a completely new
  network layout make sure that the lock position button is disabled.
Show all reachable metabolites within number of reactions from a specific metabolite:
  When a single metabolite is supplied to MetaboNetworks, it shows all directly connected metabolites by default.
  A new button is added (MPL) which allows the user to set the Maximal Path Length (MPL), when this is set to a
  number >0 it shows all metabolites linked with at most MPL reactions.
Show alternative paths between 2 metabolites:
  When two metabolites are supplied to MetaboNetworks, it shows the shortest paths between the two by default. The
  MPL has a different function here, if it is changed from 0 to a higher number all paths are shown that are at most
  MPL reactions longer than the shortest path.
Network is scaled with the figure:
  When the figure is resized, the network is automatically rescaled as well. The network now aims to fill the figure
  as much as possible.
Faster re-drawing of graph:
  When display properties of the graph are changed, where possible, specific elements are updated instead of
  redrawing the entire graph as a whole.
Node merge:
  Nodes can be merged, for instance L-Leucine and D-Leucine can be merged to remain in the network as one.
Deletion of layouts:
  UEL and UEL ellipse layouts have been removed.
Colour by association:
  Now recognizes whether the supplied data can be interpreted as class or is continuous.
New selection tools:
  Select all metabolites
  Select all biomarker metabolites
Change of function:
  Change background colour now changes the colour for selected nodes (or for all if none are selected.
  Same for the change node border colour.
  If a node of the circular network layout is moved, the network is transformed to show all nodes as horizontal
      textboxes (the new layout is spring-electrical embedding, however it is not optimized as such unless the user
      does so themselves.
Apply parameters from a node to other nodes:
  A button is added which asks the user to select a node whose parameters can be applied on all or selected nodes,
     or set as defaults

5.1

Updated functions GetRPData and GetRPData_Outer to reflect changes in KEGG.

5.2

Updated function MetaboNetworksGUIv2 to reflect changes in KEGG.
